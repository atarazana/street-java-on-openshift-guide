= Deploy a new version
include::_attributes.adoc[]

Now, let's do something easy, apparently harmless, let's build a new image and deploy it. Myabe you didn't notice but you were using a pre-built image part of the lab... if you didn't notice till now don't tell your colleagues, look smart and scratch your chin as if just had another good idea.

[#anatomy-of-your-chart]
== Anatomy of your Chart

You have deployed the Street Java app using a `helm chart`. Let's have a look at the relevant parts of it.

*The chart*

The chart resides at `helm/street-java` there you will find:

- *Chart.yaml*, definition of the chart and where you define the dependencies
- *charts*, folder containing the chart your chart depend on
- *values.yaml*, general values file that tune youb

_Chart.yaml_

appVersion: "1.0.0"

dependencies: <2>
  - name: fruit-gateway
  - name: fruit-service
----
<1> Chart name
<2> Chart your chart depend on

*The depencies*

As you saw above our chart depends on two charts: `fruit-gateway` and `fruit-service`.

This charts are in folder `helm/street-java/charts` and each of them consists of the same sections as the general chart: `Chart.yaml`, `charts` and `values` _AND_ another folder; *`templates`*.

Is in the `templates` folder where you will find templates to create the `Deployments`, `Services`, `Routes`, `ConfigMaps`, etc.

_values.yaml_

The `values.yaml` file is where you can tweak the installation of a chart using different values for certain attributes. In our case there is a general `values` file and another two for each of the charts `fruit-gateway` and `fruit-service`. The primary `values` file allows you to override the `values` of the secondary `values` files.

For instance, here you are the values in the primary `values.yaml` file:

NOTE: Values for a chart are in a section called as the correponding chart.

[#building-a-new-version]
== Building a New Version

Before we actually deploy a new version we have to make a change in the code and build the new image.

Please, open `fruit-gateway/src/main/resources/application.properties` and change the value of property `config.service.name` to `fruit-gateway`.

[source,properties,attributes]
----
config.service.name=fruit-gateway
----

Now build the image:

[.console-input]
[source,sh, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
./fruit-gateway/image-build.sh 
----

This is the expected result:

[.console-output]
[source,sh, subs="+macros,+attributes"]

[#pushing-new-image]
== Pushing New Image

Once we have our new image we have to push it to the image registry. In this lab we have installed Quay for you so that you use it as you would use your own enterprise registry.

In order to copy the image you're going to use `skopeo`, if you want to learn more about this utility go to link:https://skopeo.io[skopeo].

Before you can copy the image to need to log in the registry server:

[.console-input]
[source,sh, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
skopeo login -u {username} -p {password} {quay-server}
----

You should see this message:

[.console-output]
[source,sh, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
Login Succeeded!
----

Run this command to load some environment variables:

[.console-input]
[source,sh, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
export PROJECT_ID=street-java
export ARTIFACT_VERSION=$(mvn -f fruit-gateway/pom.xml help:evaluate -Dexpression=project.version -q -DforceStdout)
export ARTIFACT_ID=$(mvn -f fruit-gateway/pom.xml help:evaluate -Dexpression=project.artifactId -q -DforceStdout)
export GIT_HASH=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
----

Now, you're logged in and the environmen is set, let's copy the image:

[.console-input]
[source,sh, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
skopeo copy containers-storage:localhost/${PROJECT_ID}-${ARTIFACT_ID}:${GIT_HASH} docker://{quay-server}/{username}/${PROJECT_ID}-${ARTIFACT_ID}:${GIT_HASH}
----

If it all goes well, you will see messages like these:

[.console-output]
[source,sh, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----

[#getting-the-image-digest]
== Getting the Image Digest

Finally let's obtain the digest of the image you just pushed to the registry, you will needed later:

[.console-input]
[source,sh, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
export IMAGE_DIGEST_RAW=$(skopeo inspect docker://{quay-server}/{username}/${PROJECT_ID}-${ARTIFACT_ID}:${GIT_HASH} | jq -r .Digest)
export IMAGE_DIGEST=${IMAGE_DIGEST_RAW:7}
echo ${IMAGE_DIGEST}
----

You will get a string like this:

[.console-output]
[source,sh, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
b9c14b03f13206dd25e92a629d8d8d6709132b25b68a39f648c8dee3d57a0bb9
----

[#update-image-digest]
== Update the Image Digest in values.yaml

It's time to update the digest of the new `fruit-gateway` image in the primary `values.yaml` file. Open `./helm/street-java/values.yaml` locate these properties:

[source,yaml,attributes]
----
fruit-gateway:
  enabled: true
  image:
    repository: quay.io/atarazana/street-java-fruit-gateway@sha256
    tag: "3d0787554a289b6235f4cd424a2642ed8d5fed41c627a2fe3b8e0acf14272420"
----

Substitute `repository` with the one below, and substite the string `NEW_TAG` with the digest you got before and that should be in the environment variable `IMAGE_DIGEST`.

[.console-input]
[source,yaml, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
fruit-gateway:
  enabled: true
  image:
    repository: {quay-server}/{username}/street-java-fruit-gateway@sha256
    tag: "NEW_TAG" 
----

Once you have changed the values of `fruit-gateway->image->repository` and `fruit-gateway->image->tag` please run this command to upgrade the helm chart:

[.console-input]
[source,sh, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
helm upgrade street-java helm/street-java
----

Expect and output similar to this one:

[.console-output]
[source,sh, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
Release "street-java" has been upgraded. Happy Helming!

LAST DEPLOYED: Mon Feb 20 18:31:59 2023
NAMESPACE: {street-java-namespace}
STATUS: deployed

[#did-it-work]
== Did it Work?

Let's find out it our app still works properly. If you open the next link and pay attention to the `fruit-gateway` deployment.

[.console-input]
[source,sh, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
{street-java-link}
----

Or run the next command:

[.console-input]
[source,sh, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
curl https://$(oc get route/fruit-gateway -o jsonpath='{.spec.host}')/api/config | jq .
----

You will think... Yes, it's still there, alive and kicking... but the devil is in the details...

Let's have a look to the deployment object:

[.console-input]
[source,sh, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc get deployment/fruit-gateway -n {street-java-namespace} -o yaml
----

And you should get something like:

[.console-output]
[source,sh, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
...
status:
  availableReplicas: 1
  conditions:
  - lastTransitionTime: "2023-02-20T18:26:04Z"
    lastUpdateTime: "2023-02-20T18:26:04Z"
    message: Deployment has minimum availability.
    reason: MinimumReplicasAvailable
    status: "True"
    type: Available

    lastUpdateTime: "2023-02-20T18:39:34Z"

  readyReplicas: 1
  replicas: 2
  unavailableReplicas: 1
  updatedReplicas: 1
----
<1> It's progressing!

Ok, so it's still working but with the previous image... that means we have to keep digging.

[#events]
== Events

One way to find out why something is not working properly is having a look to the `Events` stream.

Run this command 

[.console-input]
[source,sh, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc get events -n {street-java-namespace} | grep Failed
----

You should see some good candidates like:

[.console-output]
[source,sh,attributes]
----
17m         Warning   Failed              pod/fruit-gateway-d5b78849b-jmt7d     Failed to pull image "myregistry-quay-quay-system.apps.cluster-fcj9p.fcj9p.sandbox1011.opentlc.com/user1/street-java-fruit-gateway@sha256:b9c14b03f13206dd25e92a629d8d8d6709132b25b68a39f648c8dee3d57a0bb9": rpc error: code = Unknown desc = reading manifest sha256:b9c14b03f13206dd25e92a629d8d8d6709132b25b68a39f648c8dee3d57a0bb9 in myregistry-quay-quay-system.apps.cluster-fcj9p.fcj9p.sandbox1011.opentlc.com/user1/street-java-fruit-gateway: unauthorized: access to the requested resource is not authorized

----

It looks like the new image we just pushed to our enterprise registry cannot be pulled. That should ring a bell... maybe the repository we created by pushing a *first* image has created a *private* registry... Let's find out.

IMPORTANT: At the end of the first line you will find this message _unauthorized: access to the requested resource is not authorized_

Open the next link to the registry and check if our guess is correct.

[NOTE]
====
Use this credentials:

- *User:* {username}
- *Password:* {password}
====

[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+attributes"]
----
https://{quay-server}/repository/{username}/street-java-fruit-gateway
----

You should be able to see the lock icon near the top indicating that the `{username}/street-java-fruit-gateway` repository is private.

image:fruit-gateway-repository-private.png[New Repository Private]

Ok, so you need to make your deployment use some credentials to allow it to pull the new image... well, let's get started.
