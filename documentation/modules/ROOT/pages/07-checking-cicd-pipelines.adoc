= Checking CICD Pipelines
include::_attributes.adoc[]

[#overview]
== Overview

Well, so far we have used the command line to create the ArgoCD root application that in its turn has created all the needed elements:

- ClusterTasks
- Pipelines
- Triggers

All those elements have been created in namespace devoted to CICD, let's have a look at the pipelines. Open the OpenShift web console and navigate to the CICD project (_red arrow_).

NOTE: Make sure that on the upper left corner the "Administrator" view is selected and that you are in the *'Home->Projects'* section.

Now navigate to 'Pipelines->Pipelines'. As you can see there are CI and CD pipelines for each microservice.

[#events-ci-pipeline]
=== Events CI Pipeline

Le's have a look to the *CI pipeline* for the *gramola-events* microservice *'events-ci-pl'*. As you can see is made of a series of tasks:

- *fetch-repository:* Fetches the *gramola-events* code fro the Gitea repository you migrated before
- *package:* Compiles and packages the code in a JAR file
- *build:* Builds a container image starting from a Containerfile, pushes it to the registry of images and saves the hash in an output variable
- *fetch-config-repository:* Fetches the configuration of Gramola (remember git is the source of truth for ArgoCD)
- *update-image:* Updates the hash in the *kustomization file* in the `dev` overlay of *gramola-events* but in a short lived feature branch
- *gitea-pr-create:* Creates a *Pull Request* with the *feature branch* over the *main branch*
- *github-pr-create:* _N/A in this case we use Gitea_

NOTE: This is just an example covering the bare minimum tasks of a CI pipeline! Of course there should be other critical tasks such as: unit testing, code quality, ...

[#when-expressions-to-the-rescue]
==== 'When Expressions' to the rescue

Have another look at the pipeline diagram and check that there are two tasks that could potentially run in paralell `gitea-pr-create` and `github-pr-create`. Altought these tasks could run in paralell we don't want that to happen because one is targeted to *Gitea* and the other one to *Github*.

*What have we done to be sure that only the proper task is run?*

We have used 'when expressions', for instance this is the when expression that will trigger task `gitea-pr-create` only if the *GIT_PROVIDER* is *gitea*, which is the case by the way.

[.console-input]
[source,yaml, subs="+attributes"]
----
- name: gitea-pr-create
  ...
  when:
    - input: $(params.GIT_PROVIDER)
        operator: in
        values:
        - gitea
----

Please, copy the next link and paste it in a new tab to open our CI pipeline and have a look to the pipeline diagram.

[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+attributes"]
----
https://console-openshift-console.apps.%BASE_SUBDOMAIN%/k8s/ns/gramola-cicd-{username}/tekton.dev~v1beta1~Pipeline/events-ci-pl
----

You can have a look to the diagram, hover over the tasks or take a look at the yaml.

[#events-cd-pipeline]
=== Events CD Pipeline

Now, navigate back and open the *CD pipeline* for *gramola-events*, called *'events-cd-pl'*. This time the list of tasks is shorter...

- *argocd-sync:* This triggers both the refresh from the configuration git repository and the assets synchronization using the `argocd` cli.
- *fetch-config-repository:* Fetches the configuration of Gramola (remember git is the source of truth for ArgoCD)
- *update-image:* Updates the hash in the *kustomization file* in the `dev` overlay of *gramola-events* but in a short lived feature branch
- *gitea-pr-create:* Creates a *Pull Request* with the *feature branch* over the *main branch*
- *github-pr-create:* _N/A in this case we use Gitea_

image::pipelines-check-4.png[Pipelines Check 4]

Finally if you navigate to 'Pipelines->Triggers' you'll see there are many of them, we'll only use those for Gitea but the example is ready for receiving events from GitHub and GitLab. 

image::pipelines-check-5.png[Pipelines Check 5]

Well, triggers are in place but we need web hooks to feed them!

[#tekton-triggers]
== Tekton Triggers

One key element in DevOps is the ability to run CI and CD pipelines whenever changes are made to the source code or deployment configuration (as in the case of GitOps). In general we achieve this by setting webhooks in our git repos.

The idea is simple, whenever you interact with a git repository internal events are generated, if you create a webhook for certain events those events (JSON objects in our case) are sent out to a URL. In our case the URL is the route of an *EventListener*. An *EventLister* is nothing more than a POD that runs some logic that filters, transforms and maps raw event data to create a *PipelineRun* object. The following picture shows how the event is sent out from the webhook to the event listener route and from there through a *Service* to a pod which runs the *EventListener* logic.

[#event-listener]
=== Event Listener

Find below an example of *EventListener*, as you can see this descriptor *_ties together interceptors and bindings to prepare data for a template_*.

[source,yaml, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
apiVersion: triggers.tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: EventListener
metadata:
  name: events-ci-pl-push-gitea-listener
spec:
  triggers:
    - name: gitea-listener
      interceptors:
        - ref:
            apiVersion: triggers.tekton.dev
            kind: ClusterInterceptor
            name: github <1>
          params:
            - name: eventTypes
              value:
                - push
      bindings:
        - kind: TriggerBinding
          ref: events-ci-pl-push-gitea-trigger-binding <2>
      template:
        ref: events-ci-pl-push-trigger-template <3>
----
1. This *interceptor* is for Github (also works for Gitea) and let in only the push events
2. This is the reference to the *TriggerBinding* we want to use
3. Reference to the *Template* that is used to create the *PipelineRun*

The *EventListener* logic proceeds as follows:

. Once the event reaches the pod, the defined *Interceptors* are executed to turn the raw event data into a well defined payload.
. *Bindings* are in charge of mapping raw event values to variables which can be used later
.  The *Template* is where the mapped and trasformed data is used to create a *PipelineRun* object which will be used to execute the corresponding pipeline.


The following picture shows graphically the flow explained above.

[#trigger-binding]
=== Trigger Binding

Let's have a closer look to the *TriggerBinding* descriptor.

[source,yaml, subs="+attributes"]
----
apiVersion: triggers.tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: TriggerBinding
metadata:
  name: events-ci-pl-push-gitea-trigger-binding <1>
spec:
  params:
    - name: gitRepositoryUrl <2> 
      value: $(body.repository.clone_url) <3>
    - name: gitRepository
      value: $(body.repository.full_name)
    - name: gitRevision
      value: $(body.after)
    - name: contentType
      value: $(header.Content-Type)
    - name: gitId
      value: $(body.after)
    - name: gitProvider
      value: gitea
----
1. Name used to refer to from the *EventListener*
2. Name of a parameter to be created
3. Attribute from the event payload mapped to the parameter to be created

[#trigger-template]
=== Trigger Template

Finally let's do the same with the TriggerTemplate.

[source,yaml, subs="+attributes"]
----
apiVersion: triggers.tekton.dev/v1alpha1
kind: TriggerTemplate
metadata:
  name: events-ci-pl-push-trigger-template
spec:
  params: <1>
    - name: gitRepositoryUrl
    - name: gitRepository
    - name: gitRevision
    - name: gitId
    - name: gitProvider
  resourcetemplates: <2>
    - apiVersion: tekton.dev/v1beta1
      kind: PipelineRun
      metadata:
        generateName: events-ci-pl-push-plr-
        labels:
          app.kubernetes.io/instance: events
          pipeline.openshift.io/runtime: quarkus
          pipeline.openshift.io/type: knative
          tekton.dev/pipeline: events-ci-pl
        namespace: gramola-cicd-{username}
      spec:
        params:
          - name: APP_NAME
            value: gramola-events
          - name: GIT_PROVIDER
            value: $(tt.params.gitProvider)
          - name: GIT_REPO
            value: $(tt.params.gitRepositoryUrl)
          - name: GIT_REPO_NAME
            value: $(tt.params.gitRepository)
          - name: GIT_REVISION
            value: $(tt.params.gitRevision)
          - name: GIT_REPO_CONFIG
            value: >-
              https://repository-gitea-system.apps.%BASE_SUBDOMAIN%/{username}/gramola.git
          - name: GIT_REVISION_CONFIG
            value: main
          - name: IMAGE_NAME
            value: quay.io/dummy/gramola-events
          - name: IMAGE_TAG
            value: $(tt.params.gitRevision)
          - name: PATH_CONTEXT
            value: .
          - name: QUARKUS_PROFILE
            value: prod
          - name: DB_HOST
            value: events-database
          - name: REVISION_NAME
            value: v1
        pipelineRef: <3>
          name: events-ci-pl
        serviceAccountName: build-bot <4>
        timeout: 1h0m0s
        workspaces: <5>
          - name: workspace-source
            persistentVolumeClaim:
              claimName: events-source-pvc
          - name: workspace-cache
            persistentVolumeClaim:
              claimName: events-cache-pvc
----
1. These parameters should have been defined in the *TriggerBinding*
2. Resources to be created (a *PipelineRun* in this case) using literals and parameters from the *TriggerBinding* (`tt``)
3. *Reference to the pipeline to be run* using the *PipelineRun* object created with this template
4. *ServiceAccount* to be used when running the pipeline
5. *Workspaces* mapped to storages, using PVCs in this case


[NOTE]
====
Interceptors are specific for the source of the event, hence, in general, specific for the git provider: github, gitlab, etc., and the event itself.

For example the interceptor for the *PushEvent* from *GitHub* will put the *git repository url* into *$(body.repository.clone_url)* and the *git revision* into *$(body.after)*.
