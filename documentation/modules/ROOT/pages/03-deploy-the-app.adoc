[#checking-helm-cli]
== Check `heml` cli works properly

As you already know deploying applications in kubernetes can be done in many ways... we have decided to choose `helm` but before we actually use it to deploy `Street Java` let's be sure the binary is in the `PATH` and the version is the one required... Please run this command:

[.console-input]
[source,sh, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
helm version
----

Expect something like this:

[.console-output]
[source,sh, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
version.BuildInfo{Version:"v3.6.2+5.el8", GitCommit:"eb607dd4f123eaedab662cef21008d177f2c3426", GitTreeState:"clean", GoVersion:"go1.15.13"}

[#installing-street-java]
== Installing Street Java

Ok, we're ready to deploy our application. As part of the lab prepararion we have created a project for you: `{street-java-namespace}`. Run this command to be sure this project is the default one.

[.console-input]
[source,sh, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc project {street-java-namespace}
----

Now let's install our helm chart:

[.console-input]
[source,sh, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
helm install street-java helm/street-java
----

This is the expected result:

[.console-output]
[source,sh, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
NAME: street-java
LAST DEPLOYED: Thu Feb 16 19:19:35 2023
NAMESPACE: street-java
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
----

Awesome, you did it, but just to be sure open the next link to check if the app works properly.

[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+attributes"]
----
https://{openshift-console-host}/topology/ns/{street-java-namespace}?view=graph
----

Well aparently something is not ok... you should see something like this, and that's not a good sign.

In fact if you run the following command you'll see that no pods have been created!

[.console-input]
[source,sh, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
oc get deploy -n {street-java-namespace}
----

You'll get:

NOTE: 0/1 in `READY` means 0 of 1 containers are ready... and we don't want that!

// If you see the app UI and all is green then you can look one side and the other, grin and feel awesome... you'll feel bad later.
