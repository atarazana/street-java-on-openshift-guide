Checking the status of an operators is a bit counterintuitive because we that something bad is false. As you can see below `Type` of condition is `CatalogSourcesUnhealthy`, which is a bad thing, but the `Status` is `False` so it's a good thing ;-)

   Reason:                AllCatalogSourcesHealthy

Because the message is less counterintuitive  let's check that instead. Please run this command to check the status of the operator.

[.console-input]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
echo $(oc get subs/openshift-gitops-operator -n openshift-operators -o jsonpath='{.status.conditions[0].message}')
----

If the operator is fine you should get this response.

[.console-output]
[source,bash, subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
all available catalogsources are healthy
